# IS5126_FinalProject (Twitter Sentiment Analysis)

## Project Proposal
https://docs.google.com/document/d/11AiB-DH1y1JmC6Exy9ueZtsMPgN456oMRJLmnWP_-zs/edit?tab=t.0

## Dataset can be found here

## Use the split feature files

The feature file have been split because its size exceeded limitation.
We should combine them before using.

# Word2Vec Feature Engineering for Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Directory Structure
Word2Vec/
├── Word2Vec.py # Main implementation code
├── word2vec_twitter.model # Trained Word2Vec model
├── word2vec_features_part1.npy # Feature vectors (part 1)
├── word2vec_features_part2.npy # Feature vectors (part 2)
└── sentiment_labels.npy # Sentiment labels

## Feature Engineering Process
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Text cleaning and normalization
   - Negation handling (e.g., "not good" → "NEG_good")
   - Stop words removal
   - Special characters handling

2. **Word2Vec Model Parameters**
   - Vector size: 200 dimensions
   - Window size: 8
   - Minimum word count: 2
   - Negative sampling: 15
   - Training epochs: 25

## Using the Features
The feature vectors have been split due to GitHub file size limitations. To use them:

```python
# Load and combine features
part1 = np.load("word2vec_features_part1.npy")
part2 = np.load("word2vec_features_part2.npy")
features = np.vstack([part1, part2])

# Load sentiment labels
labels = np.load("sentiment_labels.npy")
```

## Model Details
- Training data: 72,145 tweets after preprocessing
- Each tweet is represented by a 200-dimensional vector
- Features are generated by averaging word vectors for each tweet
- Handles negations and special sentiment expressions

## File Descriptions
- `Word2Vec.py`: Implementation of Word2Vec feature engineering
- `word2vec_twitter.model`: Trained Word2Vec model
- `word2vec_features_part1.npy`: First half of feature vectors
- `word2vec_features_part2.npy`: Second half of feature vectors
- `sentiment_labels.npy`: Corresponding sentiment labels

## Data Source
Original dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis/data

```python
# load and combine features
part1 = np.load("word2vec_features_part1.npy")
part2 = np.load("word2vec_features_part2.npy")
features = np.vstack([part1, part2])

# load sentiment labels
labels = np.load("sentiment_labels.npy")
```
```
